# Prework Study Guide Web Application

## Description

The motive for creating this webpage was to provide a study guide for those who are new to coding, whether they are also beginning the Coding Bootcamp through UCSD or simply learning how to code on their own time.
This project was completed in order to give myself the proper foundation to learn more about coding and to much greater depths as I am pursuing a career in software engineering. 
The webpage helps others, as well as myself, build the foundation of coding web applications and learning various computer languages. It may also be used to brush up on the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
Throughout the course of this project, I have learned how to maintain my website through Git and the GitHub, as well as the basics in the languages that I previously mentioned. I have YET to become fluent with these skills, however, with more time and practice, I will.
